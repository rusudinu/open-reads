### Stories

1. As a user, I want to be able to search for books by title, author, genre, etc.
2. For each book, I want to be able to add it to different shelves. The books that I want to read should be added to the “Want to Read” shelf, the books that I am currently reading should be added to the “Currently Reading” shelf, and the books that I have already read should be added to the “Read” shelf.
3. As a user, I should be able to rate each book with a score ranging from 1 to 5 stars and write a review.
4. As a user, I want to be able to see the books that I have read, the books that I am currently reading, and the books that I want to read, so that I can keep track of my reading progress, on a profile page.
5. As a user, I want to be able to see what my friends are reading, and what books are on the same topic that they are currently reading, so that I can find new books to read.
6. I would also like to see recommended books based on the topics that I am interested in.
