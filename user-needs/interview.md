Q: Hi there! Can you tell me a bit about yourself and your reading habits?

A: Hi! Sure, I'm a big reader and I try to read a little bit of everything, from fiction to non-fiction. I usually read before bed or during my commute to work.

Q: Great to hear! So, what are you looking for in a Goodreads clone?

A: Well, I want an app that makes it easy for me to keep track of what I've read and what I want to read. I also want to be able to see reviews and ratings from other readers, and discover new books based on my interests.
    
Q: How do you currently keep track of your reading list?

A: Right now, I usually just write down book titles in a note on my phone or in a notebook. It's not very organized, so I'm hoping an app can help me stay on top of things.

Q: Got it. And how do you usually discover new books to read?

A: I usually read books from authors I've read before, and sometimes I'll ask friends for recommendations.

Q: Okay, so it sounds like you're looking for an app that can help you with organization and discovery. Are there any other features you'd like to see in the app?

A: One thing that would be nice is if the app could recommend books based on what I've read in the past, or suggest books that are similar to ones I've liked. And it would be great if I could connect with other readers and join groups to discuss books.
